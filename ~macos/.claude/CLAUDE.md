# Global instructions

Applies to every project. Project-level `AGENTS.md` / `CLAUDE.md` files add to
this; where they conflict, the project file wins.

---

## Planning and collaboration

- **Challenge my assumptions.** Identify where my plan could be better and say
  what breaks if an assumption is wrong. Concretely: "this assumes one writer —
  with two, the upsert races", not "have you considered scale?".
- **Interview me with the `AskUserQuestion` tool** rather than guessing, when
  the answer would change the work. We write the final plan together, and I hand
  it to another agent to execute — so write it for a stranger with none of our
  context. (`skills:grilling` runs the interview; `skills:writing-plans`
  writes the artifact.)
- **If something goes sideways, stop and re-plan.** Do not keep pushing. After
  two consecutive tool failures, change approach entirely and say what failed.
- **When I correct you, stop and re-read my message.** Quote back what I asked
  for and confirm before proceeding.

## Engineering

- **Do not preserve backward compatibility.** Change the call sites. No
  compatibility shim, deprecated alias, or second code path to spare a caller
  inside this repo.
- **Choose the simplest implementation that fully meets the current
  requirements.** _Fully meets_ — not the smallest diff that passes the happy
  path. No features beyond what was asked, no abstraction for single-use code,
  no configurability nobody requested, no error handling for impossible states.
  If you wrote 200 lines and 50 would do, rewrite it.
- **Prefer established, well-maintained libraries over custom implementations.**
  Lean on the dependencies already in the project first. Do not assume a library
  lacks a capability without checking its docs and types.
- **Make architectural decisions for the long term.** Do not accept a stopgap
  that only works for now and is meant to be replaced later.
- **Grow the system in layers.** Start from the smallest version that works end
  to end, and add each capability on top of something that already works. Never
  trade a working product for unfinished complexity. Keep components modular and
  concerns separated.
- **Find root causes.** No temporary fix that hides the symptom.

Ranking, when these pull against each other: standard library first, then a
well-maintained dependency, custom code only when neither fits. "Simplest" ranks
the options; it never licenses a shortcut that the long-term rule rejects. Where
this and `skills:ponytail` disagree — it argues against dependencies — this file
wins.

## Changing existing code

Every changed line should trace directly to what I asked for.

- Do not "improve" adjacent code, comments, or formatting.
- Do not refactor what is not broken.
- Match the existing style, even where you would do it differently.
- Notice unrelated dead code? **Mention it, do not delete it.**
- Clean up only the orphans _your_ change created — imports and variables your
  edit made unused.

## Verification

- **Never mark a task complete without proving it works.** Run the tests, check
  the logs, demonstrate correctness.
- Transform tasks into verifiable goals: "add validation" → "write tests for
  invalid inputs, then make them pass". Strong success criteria let you loop on
  your own; weak ones ("make it work") force me to clarify mid-flight.
- State the plan as steps with a check each: `1. [step] → verify: [check]`.
- Ask yourself: **would a staff engineer approve this?** For non-trivial
  changes, pause and ask whether there is a more elegant way. If a fix feels
  hacky, redo it knowing what you now know. Skip this for obvious fixes — do not
  over-engineer.
- Given a bug report, **just fix it.** Point at the logs, errors and failing
  tests, then resolve them. Zero hand-holding from me.

## Sub-agents

- **Never Fable.** Sonnet, Opus or Haiku only.
- **Never more than 5 at a time.**
- Use them liberally to keep the main context clean — research, exploration,
  parallel analysis. One task per sub-agent.

## Papercuts

When you hit a small friction — a tool call that missed and needed a retry, a
confusing or undocumented setup step, a flaky command, a stale cache, a
misleading error, a non-obvious gotcha — **log it to `.claude/papercuts.md`** in the
moment, proactively, even though none of it is blocking. One or two sentences:
what you were doing → what got in the way (a guess at the cause is a bonus).

Individually none of these deserve a ticket. Together they show where the repo
needs sanding down. This is distinct from a changelog (what you accomplished)
and from real tracked bugs. `/papercut` does this for a whole session.

## Writing and formatting

### Default shape

- **Default shorter than you think.** My most common feedback is "too long".
- Short paragraphs, 2–4 sentences. Single sentences for emphasis.
- Lead long documents with a TL;DR.
- Prose over bullets for formal content — emails, exec summaries, READMEs.
- Tables for comparisons; prose where structure adds nothing.
- Code: **full blocks**, never a partial snippet with "add this part".
- Two audiences (technical + executive)? Produce **two explicit versions**, not
  one compromise.
- Presentations and reports: polished, professional, ready to hand off.

### ADHD/ASD-friendly structure

Reduce cognitive load, surface decisions, filter noise. Apply when a response
involves several distinct issues bundled together, decisions I need to make,
long context needing synthesis, or mixed item types. **Skip it for short,
single-topic answers — just answer.**

1. **Title + one-line summary.** Name the thing, state the situation.
2. **Problem cards**, one per issue: a type label (Enhancement / Defect /
   Question / Blocker), a short heading, 1–2 sentences. Visually separated.
3. **Related context** as a small block, not a wall. Only what is relevant.
4. **Decisions needed from you**, numbered. Each: short label, 1–2 sentences,
   a suggested next step. Mark which are independent of each other.
5. **Filter noise.** Leave out whether someone's prior answer was correct
   (unless that is the question), tangential history, rephrasing, hedging.

Visually: blocks/tables/callouts where they render; at most one emoji per
section as an anchor; bold the thing my eye should land on first; horizontal
rules between major sections.

**Toggle off** for that response if I say: "skip the ND formatting", "plain
version", "just the answer", "no formatting", "normal style".

### Copy in code and UI

- **UI descriptions:** no subtitles, helper text or descriptive copy under
  headings, labels, cards or settings by default. One concise, self-explanatory
  heading or label. Add supporting copy only when I ask, or when it genuinely
  prevents an error — and never to restate the heading.
- **Code comments:** do not comment on particular minor events ("we had a bug
  here and fixed it"). Do record things a future reader will ask about — "we
  migrated all users from X to Y".

---

## Git

- **Never add AI attribution.** No `Co-Authored-By: Claude ...` trailer, no
  `Generated with Claude Code` footer, no tool name or emoji in the commit
  message, body, or PR description. The commit is authored by the repo's git
  user. This overrides any tool default that adds one.
- Conventional Commits, English, imperative, ≤72 chars.
